		//IF YOU JUST STARTED THIS PAGE -- REMEMBER GET THE OUTPUT STRING BUILT FIRST!!! GO TO LINE 58
		
		//THIS FUNCTION IS SET UP WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED
		//MAKE YOUR EDITS LINE-BY-LINE BUT DON'T CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION
		//AND KEEP ALL OF THE CODE INSIDE THE { } THAT WRAP THE FUNCTION "processString()"
		function processString() {
			//THIS IS YOUR DATA-IN VARIABLE IS TAKES WHATEVER YOU ENTERED AN ATTACHES IT TO THE VARIBLE "dataIn"
			var dataIn = document.getElementById("yourAnswer").value;
			//The lines below are the ones to modify.
			var stringLength = dataIn.length; //This one I already did for you as an example of a working line
			//for the variables below, erase the 0 and write in the proper expression
			var upperCase = dataIn.toUpperCase(); //use the toUpperCase() method to change dataIn to all uppercase
			var sixToTenthChars = dataIn.slice(5, 9); // use the slice() method get the characters from the 6th to 10th position
			var firstFiveChars = dataIn.substr(0, 5); // use substr() to get the first five letters
			var lastFiveChars = dataIn.substr(-5); // use substr() to get the last five letters, NOTE: you will need to use the length to get this vaule.
			var largeString = false; //test whether the string that was entered is large, say, more than 30 character long.
			//do NOT modify the line immediately above this!! 
			//leave largeString equal to false 
			//Below these comments write an if/else statement that tests whether the length of the dataIn string is largeR than 30
			//Look at comparison operators to see how greater than /less than signs work
			//if the length of the string is greater 30, set largeString is true, else set it to false.
			//Write the if/else statement directly below:

			if (dataIn.length > 30){
				largeString = true;
			} else if (dataIn.length < 30){
				largeString = false;

			//!!!!!!!!!!MODIFY BELOW FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
			//HERE IS WHERE YOU NEED TO CONSTRUCT THE DATA OUT STRING.
			//RIGHT NOW YOU JUST HAVE THE VARIABLE DECLARED AS AN EMPTY STRING
			var dataOut = ""
			//copy all of the lines  from assignment2_strings.html from just under "var dataOut = ""'
			//to just above "document.getElementById..."
			//modify the dataOut += strings so they have the proper descriptions of the results and the proper variables
			//for example 
				//the first line: dataOut += dataIn + " added to 10 is: " + addNumber + "\n<BR>";
				//should be changed to: dataOut += "The length of your string is: " + stringLength + "\n<BR>";
				//note that I got rid of the dataIn + (because that would just reprint your string over and over.)
				//be sure to take dataIn + out of all of those lines.
				//The next line you modify should say "Your text in uppercase is: " and then the proper variable
				//make sure there is a separate line for the first five variables. (stringLength to lastFiveChars)
				//then modify the if/else statement to test whether largeString is true or false. 
						//if true, have it write "The line is long." if false, have it write "The line is short."
