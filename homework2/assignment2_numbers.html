			//BELOW IS YOUR DATA-IN VARIABLE IS TAKES WHATEVER YOU ENTERED AN ATTACHES IT TO THE VARIBLE "dataIn"
			//Note: I had to change the value with a built-in javascript Number() function -- inputs default to strings so if I didn't change it to a number "1" + 11 would equal 111.	
			//If that note was confusing, don't worry about, just don't modify this line!!		
			var dataIn = Number(document.getElementById("yourAnswer").value);
			//The lines below are the ones to modify.
			var addNumber = dataIn + 10; //This one I already did for you as an example of a working line
			var subtractNumber = 0; // Modify this line (erase the 0) (subtract dataIn variable from the number 10)
			var multiplyNumber = 0; // Multiply the input number by 10
			var divideNumber = 0; // divide the number you entered by 10
			var numberIsOdd = false; //test whether the number is odd or even -- this is a little tricker...
			//do NOT modify the line immediately above this!! 
			//leave numberIsOdd equal to false
			//Below these comments write an if/else statement that uses the modulus to test is the number is odd or even
			//look up how modulus works (it gives you a remainder from division, what would you divide a number by to test if it's even?
			//in your if-statement -- if the test gives you a remainder, set numberIsOdd = true, else set numberIsOdd = false.
			//Look at the if/else statement below for an example of syntax...
			
			
			
			
			//!!!!!!!!!!!Write the if/else statement in this space!!!!!!!!!!
			
			
			
			
			//THE REST OF THIS CODE PRINTS-OUT THE RESULTS
			//YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW
			//BUT DO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK, BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED TO USE/EDIT THIS CODE FOR THE NEXT PART OF THIS ASSIGNMENT
			//note: I declare the variable dataOut, as an empty string ""
			var dataOut = ""
			//then I keep adding strings to it. the "+=" CONCATENATE:
			//this means it adds more to the end of the string without erasing what is already contained in the variable
			//after all of the lines below are run, dataOut will be a string with 5 separate lines.
			//also note how the strings are built, the variables are added to the strings
			// that final part of the string "\n<BR>" just makes a line break after each line of text
			dataOut += dataIn + " added to 10 is: " + addNumber + "\n<BR>";
