//HELLO AND WELCOME TO PROGRAMMING!!
//THESE ARE COMMENTS: THEY ARE PLACES IN A PROGRAM WHERE YOU CAN WRITE ANYTHING!
//COMMENTS ARE FOR HUMAN READERS, NOT MACHINES.
//YOU CAN USE COMMENTS TO WRITE THINGS TO YOURSELF (SO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU ARE DOING)
//IT IS ALSO VERY NICE TO WRITE COMMENTS SO OTHER PROGRAMMERS CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR CODE
//WITHOUT SUFFERING TO FIGURING OUT THE PROGRAN BY READING CODE ALONE
//YOU CAN ALSO USE COMMENTS TO HIDE LINES OF CODE FROM THE MACHINE.


//############################
//BELOW ARE TWO GLOBAL VARIABLES: THE POEM/PROSE YOU ARE INPUTTING
//AND THE CHANGED POEM/PROSE THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL MAKE
//
var textArray = [];
var changedText = "";

//BELOW THIS SCRIPT IS AN "SRC" CALL:
//THAT IS A CALL TO ANOTHER PAGE TO BE LOADED INTO THIS PROGRAM.
//THERE ARE MANY, MUCH MORE ROBUST WAYS TO GET INTO FROM ANOTHER PAGE
//BUT THIS WAY IS THE SIMPLEST
//"textMachine.js" CONTAINS ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS THE TEXT ARRAY

//ABOVE IS JUST ABOUT THE SIMPLEST HTML YOU CAN GET
//IT JUST MAKES A PLACE ON THE BROWSER WINDOW FOR THE TEXT TO APPEAR.

//BELOW ARE CALLS TO FOUR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS 



//THIS CALLS A FUNCTION GRABS LINES RANDOMLY: SOMETIMES MAKING AN INTERESTING PSEUDO-POEM
//SOMETIMES RESULTING IN JIBBERISH
//YOU MAY ENTER THE NUMBER OF LINES YOU WANT DISPLAYED WITHIN PARENTHESIS (20)
//THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF LINE, BUT IF YOU PUT IN TONS, IT MAY BREAK YOUR BROWSER
randomLines(4);

// randomLines(4);

// randomLines(4);



//THIS CALLS A THAT FUNCTION PULLS OUT ALL THREE-WORD PHRASES THAT BEGIN WITH THE WORD YOU ENTER
//THE WORD YOU ENTER MUST BE LOWERCASE AND IN QUOTATION MARK "the"
//OF COURSE, COMMON WORDS (THE, A, BY, OF, WITH) WILL YIELD MORE RESULTS
phasesThatBeginWith("you");

//THIS CALLS A SORTING FUNCTION THAT REARRANGES THE TEXT 
//FROM SHORTEST TO LONGEST LINE OR FROM LONGEST TO SHORTEST.
//LEAVE THE PARENTHESIS EMPTY IF YOU WANT SHORT TO LONG
//WRITE IN "longest" IF YOU WANT LONG TO SHORT.
sortByLineLenght("");

//THIS ALSO CALLS A SORTING FUNCTION THAT REARRANGES THE TEXT ALPHABETICALLY.
//IF YOU RUN THIS SORTING FUNCTION IT WILL ERASE THE RESULTS OF THE FUNCTION ABOVE.
//IN POETRY THE LAST WORD OF A LINE USUALLY TAKES ON THE GREAT WEIGHT,
//SO IT SORTS ALPHABETICALLY BY THE LAST WORD OF THE LINE
// lastwordAlpha(true);

//IF YOU USE ONE OF THE SORT FUNCTIONS ABOVE, THIS CONTROLS HOW MANY LINES WILL BE DISPLAYED.
//WRITE "ALL" IF YOU WANT ALL OF THE LINES DISPLAYED. 
//OTHERWISE, PUT IN A NUMBER. IF YOU PUT IN MORE THAT ARE IN THE POEM, SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
displayLines("ALL");

///THIS TAKES ALL OF THE TEXT GENERATED BY THE FUNCTIONS
//AND DISPLAYS IT ON THE SCREEN
document.getElementById( 'displayText' ).innerHTML = changedText;
